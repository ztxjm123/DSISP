This update contains the following changes:
The API reference documentation has been updated to better explain common use cases for each method and to provide dynamic, high-quality code samples through the APIs Explorer widget. See the channels.list method's documentation for an example. There are now two new elements on pages that describe API methods:
The APIs Explorer widget lets you select authorization scopes, enter sample parameter and property values, and then send actual API requests and see actual API responses. The widget also offers a fullscreen view that shows complete code samples, which dynamically update to use the scopes and values that you have entered.
The Common use cases section describes one or more common use cases for the method explained on the page. For example, you could call the channels.list method to retrieve data about a specific channel or to retrieve data about the current user's channel.
You can use links in that section to populate the APIs Explorer with sample values for your use case or to open the fullscreen APIs Explorer with those values already populated. These changes aim to make it easier for you to see code samples that are directly applicable to the use case that you're trying to implement in your own application.
Code samples are currently supported for Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and curl.
The code samples tool has also been updated with a new UI that offers all of the same features described above. Using that tool, you can explore use cases for different methods, load values into the APIs Explorer, and open the fullscreen APIs Explorer to get code samples in Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
In conjunction with this change, the pages that previously listed available code samples for Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python have been removed.
The quickstart guides for Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python have been updated. The revised guides explain how to run one sample with an API key and another sample with an OAuth 2.0 client ID using code samples from the APIs Explorer.
